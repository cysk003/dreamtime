## Discontinued

Thank you for your interest in DreamTime, unfortunately the project has been discontinued and therefore will no longer receive updates. You can still download it for free!

We invite you to try SukebeZone+, our latest alternative available for any device with a web browser:

https://www.sukebezone.com

## Download

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/dreamnettech/dreamtime/releases) page to download the file for your platform.

## Installation

- Install DreamTime with the installer or by extracting the files from the portable version.
- DreamTime incorporates an automatic component installer that depending on several factors may not work, if that is the case, then you will need to download and install the following:
  - [DreamPower](https://github.com/sukebenet/dreampower/releases)
    - `-any.7z`: If you have an NVIDIA GPU.
    - Extract files in: %APPDATA%/dreamtime/dreampower (or similar location for your platform. For the portable version it is in the “AppData” folder located in the folder where you extracted DreamTime.)
  - [Checkpoints](https://github.com/sukebenet/deepnude-checkpoints/releases)
    - Extract files in: %APPDATA%/dreamtime/dreampower/checkpoints (or similar location for your platform. For the portable version it is in the “AppData” folder located in the folder where you extracted DreamTime.)
  - [Waifu2X](https://github.com/sukebenet/waifu2x-chainer/releases) (Optional)
    - `-any.7z`: If you have an NVIDIA GPU.
    - Extract files in: %APPDATA%/dreamtime/waifu2x (or similar location for your platform. For the portable version it is in the “AppData” folder located in the folder where you extracted DreamTime.)
- You can now use the application!

## Notes

- The following functions are no longer functional since we shut down the servers:
  - Telemetry
  - "Show Ads"
  - Share photo preferences
  - Some photo/video downloaders
- DreamTime has always focused on privacy, photos and actions within the application are not sent anywhere, everything works within your device.
